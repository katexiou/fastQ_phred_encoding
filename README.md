# Classification of FASTQ files based on Phred encoding

This repository contains scripts to generate 10 random FASTQ files, where each file has a randomly assigned Phred+33 or Phred+64 encoding. The generated FASTQ files are classified and moved into two separate directories based on their encoding format.

## Files in the Repository
1. `generate_fastq.sh`: A script that generates 10 mock FASTQ files with random sequences and quality scores, which are randomly assigned with Phred+33 or Phred+64 encoding.
2. `detect_phred.sh`: A script that detects the Phred encoding of a given FASTQ file by checking its quality scores and classifies it into either Phred+33 or Phred+64, based on their ASCII values (Phred+33: 33-74, Phred+64: 64-104).

## Requirements
- A Linux/macOS system (or WSL for Windows)
- Bash shell
- `awk`, `od`, and other standard Unix tools

## How to Run
1. Generate FASTQ Files
- To generate the random FASTQ files, simply run the following command:
`./generate_fastq.sh`.

**If permission is denied then run first the command `chmod +x generate_fastq.sh` and after `./generate_fastq.sh`**.
3. Detect and Classify Phred Encoding
- To detect the Phred encoding of the generated FASTQ files and classify them into the appropriate folders phred33 and phred64, run:
`./detect_phred.sh`.

**If permission is denied then run first the command `chmod +x detect_phred.sh` and after `./detect_phred.sh`**.

### Generated files after executing the bash scripts
1. `mock_reads_*.fastq`: 10 sample FASTQ files generated by executing `generate_fastq.sh`.
2. `phred33/`: Folder containing all FASTQ files classified with Phred+33 encoding.
3. `phred64/`: Folder containing all FASTQ files classified with Phred+64 encoding.
